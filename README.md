### Explanation of Classes and Their Functions

#### `Main` Class
- **Purpose**: Acts as the entry point of the program.
- **Functions**:
  - `main(String[] args)`: Prints "Hello world!" to the console and creates a new instance of the `Game` class to start the game.

#### `GameWindow` Class
- **Purpose**: Handles the creation and display of the game window.
- **Fields**:
  - `jframe`: A `JFrame` object used as the main window.
- **Constructor**:
  - `GameWindow(GamePanel gamePanel)`: 
    - Initializes the `jframe` object.
    - Sets the size of the window to 400x400 pixels.
    - Specifies the default close operation (closes the application on window close).
    - Adds the `GamePanel` object to the frame for rendering.
    - Makes the frame visible.

#### `Game` Class
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the game's components, such as the window and the panel.
- **Fields**:
  - `gameWindow`: Manages the game window.
  - `gamePanel`: Handles the rendering of game graphics.
- **Constructor**:
  - `Game()`: Creates a `GamePanel` instance and passes it to the `GameWindow` instance.

#### `GamePanel` Class
- **Purpose**: Represents the panel where game graphics are rendered.
- **Methods**:
  - `paintComponent(Graphics g)`:
    - Overrides `JPanel`'s method to render custom graphics.
    - Fills a rectangle at coordinates (100, 100) with width 200 and height 50 pixels using `g.fillRect`.

This setup creates a basic game structure, with a window (`GameWindow`) and a panel (`GamePanel`) where graphics can be drawn.
